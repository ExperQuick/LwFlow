```

#### 4\. Set Up Your Development Environment

python -m venv venv

# Activate it (on Windows)
# venv\Scripts\activate
# Activate it (on macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies, including testing tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest
```

#### 5\. Make Your Changes

Now, write your code\! Make your changes to the codebase, and remember to follow our style guidelines.

#### 6\. Run Tests

Before submitting, make sure your changes haven't broken anything. Run the full test suite from the root directory.

```bash
pytest
```

If you've added new functionality, please add new tests to cover it\!

#### 7\. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

```bash
# Example commit message
git commit -m "feat: Add performance_plot for multi-pipeline comparison"
```

#### 8\. Push to Your Fork

Push your new branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feature/add-new-visualization-plot
```

#### 9\. Open a Pull Request

Go to your forked repository on GitHub. You will see a prompt to create a pull request from your new branch. Click it, and fill out the pull request template with details about your changes.

  - **Link to the issue** if your PR addresses one.
  - **Describe your changes** clearly.
  - **Explain the "why"** behind your changes.

Once you submit the PR, a project maintainer will review your code. We may suggest some changes or improvements. Thank you for your contribution\!

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

  - Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
  - Use the imperative mood ("Move file to..." not "Moves file to...").
  - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
  - Reference issues and pull requests liberally in the body of the commit message.

### Python Code

  - Please follow the **PEP 8** style guide for Python code.
  - We recommend using a code formatter like `black` to automatically format your code.
